# My Personal Site

This is my personal site. :smiley:  
I'm using it to practice my frontend and backend development skills.  
Stay tuned for some cool new stuff, as I learn it! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Check it out [here](https://daughterofmaple.github.io/).

## Current TODO list

1. Fix Simon game (currently only works on Mac desktop?).
2. Add link to contact form with server side handling hosted on Heroku.
3. Include link to blog hosted on Heroku (developed with node.js and express.js).
4. Cater for night-mode.
