# My Personal Site

This is my personal site. :smiley:  
I'm using it to practice my HTML and CSS skills.  
Stay tuned for some cool new stuff, as I learn it! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Current TODO list

1. Update contact form to implement server side handling.
2. Cater for night-mode.
3. Modify positioning of history "bubbles" to be vertically centered with associated text.
