      <p class="p-profile p-profile-start">I am an engineer by trade and a problem solver at heart.</p>
      <p class="p-profile">I worked in the Design and Construct industry for a number of years, but was made redundant in the COVID pandemic. My partner and I took this opportunity to grow our family, which gave me the luxury of time to discover my
        true interest - computer programming.</p>
      <p class="p-profile">I bring with me enthusiasm, energy, and an arsenal of quality tools. I have liaised with difficult clients; I have communicated to audiences with different levels of understanding; I have defined scope, budget and program
        for small to medium-sized projects.</p>
      <p class="p-profile">After working in a number of roles both in Australia and overseas, I have come to realise that the element common to all projects and roles is human connection. Whether my task is technical, commercial or process driven,
        the final goal is to create a positive experience for the end user. Because of this, I like to explore how my own task fits in the bigger picture, to ensure that my solution contributes to achieving this goal.</p>
      <p class="p-profile">I am now excited to learn all I can about software development and share my experiences with others.</p>

              While overseas, I also completed a 3 month internship at Roland Europe, where they developed a digital accordion from idea through to design, manufacture, testing, packing, and shipping. This was my first foray into the practical side

              During my time at university, I learnt how to read a works brief (very important), brain storm solutions, work with a team to develop an idea, and communicate that idea to others.
              Although I ran the gaunlet of maths, physics, ethics and design, I believe the most valuable lesson I learnt was how to think critically when presented with a problem.
